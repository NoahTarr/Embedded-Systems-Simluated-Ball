I used the TI CC3200-Launchpad w/ a 128x128px Adafruit OLED screen to simulate a ball. The ball moves around the screen using accelerometer values pulled from the launchpad with i2c communication. The accelerometer values are passed through some logic to simulate a VERY SIMPLE physics engine. This engine starts by mapping the accelerometer values to discrete acceleration values. These values are then passed through some kinematic equations to determine velocity and position of the ball.
